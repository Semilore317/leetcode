997. Find the Town Judge

In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
If the town judge exists, then:
    The town judge trusts nobody.
    Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
    There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi. If a trust relationship does not exist in trust array, then such a trust relationship does not exist.
Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3

Example 3:
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
